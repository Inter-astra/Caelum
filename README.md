![Bannner](https://telegra.ph/file/0d71e6aac5368db1a0c0b.png)

Caelum is a small group management bot with some extra features such as sticker pack blacklist.

Originally being a [Kigy≈ç](https://t.me/Kigyorobot) fork, with some little improvements, became Caelum.

Caelum is a Latin word means Sky.

You can find this bot on [Telegram](https://t.me/Caelumet_bot), and [suppport](https://t.me/CaelumSupport) if needed.
