# Caelum - a Telegram Bot

![Bannner](https://telegra.ph/file/0d71e6aac5368db1a0c0b.png)

A small bot for my and my friends' groups, don't expect my support as I have little python knowledge ðŸ™ƒ,
but enough to do what I want too!

Caelum will stay open source since I don't need to worry about my codes being stolen,
cause i have nothing worths to steal ðŸ˜†

You can find this bot on telegram as [Caelum](https://t.me/Caelumet_bot) and [support group](https://t.me/CaelumSupport) if needed.

Caelum is a Latin word that means Sky, and themed with Kimi No Na Wa.
